					<h2>About Neil deGrasse Tyson and his work</h2>
					<h4>...more detailed</h4>

					<p class="about-details">
						Early life Tyson was born in Manhattan as the second of three
						children, into a family living in the Bronx.[3] His African-American
						father, Cyril deGrasse Tyson (1927–2016), was a sociologist, human
						resource commissioner for New York City mayor John Lindsay, and the
						first Director of Harlem Youth Opportunities Unlimited.[4][5] His
						mother, Sunchita Maria Tyson (née Feliciano; born 1928), was a
						gerontologist for the U.S. Department of Health, Education and
						Welfare, and is of Puerto Rican descent.[6] Tyson has two siblings:
						Stephen Joseph Tyson and Lynn Antipas Tyson.[4] Tyson's middle name,
						deGrasse, is from the maiden name of his paternal grandmother, who
						was born as Altima de Grasse in the British West Indies island of
						Nevis.[7] Tyson grew up in the Castle Hill neighborhood of the
						Bronx, and later in Riverdale.[8] From kindergarten throughout high
						school, Tyson attended public schools in the Bronx: PS 36 Unionport,
						PS 81 Robert J. Christen, the Riverdale Kingsbridge Academy (MS
						141), and graduated from The Bronx High School of Science in 1976
						where he was captain of the wrestling team and editor-in-chief of
						the Physical Science Journal.[9][10] His interest in astronomy began
						at the age of nine after visiting the sky theater of the Hayden
						Planetarium.[11] He recalled that "so strong was that imprint [of
						the night sky] that I'm certain that I had no choice in the matter,
						that in fact, the universe called me."[12] During high school, Tyson
						attended astronomy courses offered by the Hayden Planetarium, which
						he called "the most formative period" of his life. He credited Mark
						Chartrand III, director of the planetarium at the time, as his
						"first intellectual role model" and his enthusiastic teaching style
						mixed with humor inspired Tyson to communicate the universe to
						others the way he did.[13] Tyson obsessively studied astronomy in
						his teen years, and eventually even gained some fame in the
						astronomy community by giving lectures on the subject at the age of
						fifteen.[14] Astronomer Carl Sagan, who was a faculty member at
						Cornell University, tried to recruit Tyson to Cornell for
						undergraduate studies.[5] In his book, The Sky Is Not the Limit,
						Tyson wrote: My letter of application had been dripping with an
						interest in the universe. The admission office, unbeknownst to me,
						had forwarded my application to Carl Sagan's attention. Within
						weeks, I received a personal letter...[15] Tyson revisited this
						moment on his first episode of Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey. Pulling
						out a 1975 calendar belonging to the famous astronomer, he found the
						day Sagan invited the 17-year-old to spend a day in Ithaca. Sagan
						had offered to put him up for the night if his bus back to the Bronx
						did not come. Tyson said, "I already knew I wanted to become a
						scientist. But that afternoon, I learned from Carl the kind of
						person I wanted to become."[16][17] Tyson chose to attend Harvard
						where he majored in physics and lived in Currier House. He was a
						member of the crew team during his freshman year, but returned to
						wrestling, lettering in his senior year. He was also active in
						dance, in styles including jazz, ballet, Afro-Caribbean, and Latin
						Ballroom.[18] Tyson hosting the 40th anniversary celebration of
						Apollo 11 at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, July
						2009 Tyson earned a BA degree in physics at Harvard College in 1980
						and then began his graduate work at the University of Texas at
						Austin,[19] from which he received an MA degree in astronomy in
						1983. By his own account, he did not spend as much time in the
						research lab as he should have. His professors encouraged him to
						consider alternative careers and the committee for his doctoral
						dissertation was dissolved, ending his pursuit of a doctorate from
						the University of Texas.[20] Tyson was a lecturer in astronomy at
						the University of Maryland from 1986 to 1987[21] and in 1988, he was
						accepted into the astronomy graduate program at Columbia University,
						where he earned an MPhil degree in astrophysics in 1989, and a PhD
						degree in astrophysics in 1991[22] under the supervision of
						Professor R. Michael Rich. Rich obtained funding to support Tyson's
						doctoral research from NASA and the ARCS Foundation,[23] enabling
						Tyson to attend international meetings in Italy, Switzerland, Chile,
						and South Africa[21] and to hire students to help him with data
						reduction.[24] In the course of his thesis work, he observed using
						the 0.91 m telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory
						in Chile, where he obtained images for the Calán/Tololo Supernova
						Survey[25][26][27] helping to further their work in establishing
						Type Ia supernovae as standard candles. During his thesis research
						at Columbia University, Tyson became acquainted with Professor David
						Spergel at Princeton University, who visited Columbia University in
						the course of collaborating with his thesis advisor on the Galactic
						bulge[28][29][30] typically found in spiral galaxies. Career Tyson
						with students at the 2007 American Astronomical Society conference
						Tyson's research has focused on observations in cosmology, stellar
						evolution, galactic astronomy, bulges, and stellar formation. He has
						held numerous positions at institutions including the University of
						Maryland, Princeton University, the American Museum of Natural
						History, and the Hayden Planetarium. In 1994, Tyson joined the
						Hayden Planetarium as a staff scientist while he was a research
						affiliate in Princeton University. He became acting director of the
						planetarium in June 1995 and was appointed director in 1996.[31] As
						director, he oversaw the planetarium's $210 million reconstruction
						project, which was completed in 2000. Upon being asked for his
						thoughts on becoming director, Tyson said "when I was a kid... there
						were scientists and educators on the staff at the Hayden
						Planetarium... who invested their time and energy in my
						enlightenment... and I've never forgotten that. And to end up back
						there as its director, I feel this deep sense of duty, that I serve
						in the same capacity for people who come through the facility today,
						that others served for me".[32] Tyson has written a number of
						popular books on astrophysics. In 1995, he began to write the
						"Universe" column for Natural History magazine. In a column he
						authored for a special edition of the magazine, called "City of
						Stars", in 2002, Tyson popularized the term "Manhattanhenge" to
						describe the two days annually on which the evening sun aligns with
						the street grid in Manhattan, making the sunset visible along
						unobstructed side streets. He had coined the term in 1996, inspired
						by how the phenomenon recalls the sun's solstice alignment with the
						Stonehenge monument in England.[33] Tyson's column also influenced
						his work as a professor with The Great Courses.[34] In 2001, U.S.
						President George W. Bush appointed Tyson to serve on the Commission
						on the Future of the United States Aerospace Industry and in 2004 to
						serve on the President's Commission on Implementation of United
						States Space Exploration Policy, the latter better known as the
						"Moon, Mars, and Beyond" commission. Soon afterward, he was awarded
						the NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal, the highest civilian
						honor bestowed by NASA.[35] Tyson in December 2011 at a conference
						marking 1,000 days after the launch of the spacecraft Kepler In
						2004, Tyson hosted the four-part Origins miniseries of the PBS Nova
						series,[36] and, with Donald Goldsmith, co-authored the companion
						volume for this series, Origins: Fourteen Billion Years Of Cosmic
						Evolution.[37] He again collaborated with Goldsmith as the narrator
						on the documentary 400 Years of the Telescope, which premiered on
						PBS in April 2009.[38] As director of the Hayden Planetarium, Tyson
						bucked traditional thinking in order to keep Pluto from being
						referred to as the ninth planet in exhibits at the center. Tyson has
						explained that he wanted to look at commonalities between objects,
						grouping the terrestrial planets together, the gas giants together,
						and Pluto with like objects, and to get away from simply counting
						the planets. He has stated on The Colbert Report, The Daily Show,
						and BBC Horizon that this decision has resulted in large amounts of
						hate mail, much of it from children.[39] In 2006, the International
						Astronomical Union (IAU) confirmed this assessment by changing Pluto
						to the dwarf planet classification. Tyson recounted the heated
						online debate on the Cambridge Conference Network (CCNet), a "widely
						read, UK-based Internet chat group", following Benny Peiser's
						renewed call for reclassification of Pluto's status.[40] Peiser's
						entry, in which he posted articles from the AP and The Boston Globe,
						spawned from The New York Times's article entitled "Pluto's Not a
						Planet? Only in New York".[41][42] Tyson has been vice-president,
						president, and chairman of the board of the Planetary Society. He
						was also the host of the PBS program Nova ScienceNow until 2011.[43]
						He attended and was a speaker at the Beyond Belief: Science,
						Religion, Reason and Survival symposium in November 2006. In 2007,
						Tyson was chosen to be a regular on The History Channel's popular
						series The Universe.[citation needed] Tyson promoting the Cosmos TV
						series in Australia for National Geographic, 2014 In May 2009, Tyson
						launched a one-hour radio talk show called StarTalk, which he
						co-hosted with comedian Lynne Koplitz. The show was syndicated on
						Sunday afternoons on KTLK AM in Los Angeles and WHFS in Washington
						DC. The show lasted for thirteen weeks, but was resurrected in
						December 2010 and then, co-hosted with comedians Chuck Nice and
						Leighann Lord instead of Koplitz. Guests range from colleagues in
						science to celebrities such as GZA, Wil Wheaton, Sarah Silverman,
						and Bill Maher. The show is available via the Internet through a
						live stream or in the form of a podcast.[44] In April 2011, Tyson
						was the keynote speaker at the 93rd International Convention of the
						Phi Theta Kappa International Honor Society of the Two-year School.
						He and James Randi delivered a lecture entitled Skepticism, which
						related directly with the convention's theme of The Democratization
						of Information: Power, Peril, and Promise.[45] In 2012, Tyson
						announced that he would appear in a YouTube series based on his
						radio show StarTalk. A premiere date for the show has not been
						announced, but it will be distributed on the Nerdist YouTube
						Channel.[46] On February 28, 2014, Tyson was a celebrity guest at
						the White House Student Film Festival.[47] In 2014, Tyson helped
						revive Carl Sagan's Cosmos: A Personal Voyage television series,
						presenting Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey on both FOX and the National
						Geographic Channel. Thirteen episodes were aired in the first
						season, and Tyson has stated that if a second season were produced,
						he would pass the role of host to someone else in the science
						world.[48][49] In early January 2018, it was announced that a second
						season of Cosmos was in production, and that Tyson would once again
						act as host.[50] On April 20, 2015, Tyson began hosting a late-night
						talk show entitled StarTalk on the National Geographic Channel,
						where Tyson interviews pop culture celebrities and asks them about
						their life experiences with science.[51] Tyson is co-developing a
						sandbox video game with Whatnot Entertainment[citation needed], Neil
						deGrasse Tyson Presents: Space Odyssey, which aims to help provide
						players with a realistic simulation of developing a space-faring
						culture, incorporating educational materials about space and
						technology. The project got no new development updates since April
						2020.[52] Views Spirituality [A] most important feature is the
						analysis of the information that comes your way. And that's what I
						don't see enough of in this world. There's a level of gullibility
						that leaves people susceptible to being taken advantage of. I see
						science literacy as kind of a vaccine against charlatans who would
						try to exploit your ignorance. — Neil deGrasse Tyson, from a
						transcript of an interview by Roger Bingham on The Science
						Network[53][54] Tyson has written and broadcast extensively about
						his views of science, spirituality, and the spirituality of science,
						including the essays "The Perimeter of Ignorance"[55] and "Holy
						Wars",[56] both appearing in Natural History magazine and the 2006
						Beyond Belief workshop. In an interview with comedian Paul Mecurio,
						Tyson offered his definition of spirituality: "For me, when I say
						spiritual, I'm referring to a feeling you would have that connects
						you to the universe in a way that it may defy simple vocabulary. We
						think about the universe as an intellectual playground, which it
						surely is, but the moment you learn something that touches an
						emotion rather than just something intellectual, I would call that a
						spiritual encounter with the universe."[57] Tyson has argued that
						many great historical scientists' belief in intelligent design
						limited their scientific inquiries, to the detriment of the advance
						of scientific knowledge.[56][58] When asked during a question
						session at the University at Buffalo if he believed in a higher
						power, Tyson responded: "Every account of a higher power that I've
						seen described, of all religions that I've seen, include many
						statements with regard to the benevolence of that power. When I look
						at the universe and all the ways the universe wants to kill us, I
						find it hard to reconcile that with statements of
						beneficence."[59][60]: 341  In an interview with Big Think, Tyson
						said, "So, what people are really after is what is my stance on
						religion or spirituality or God, and I would say if I find a word
						that came closest, it would be 'agnostic' ... at the end of the day
						I'd rather not be any category at all."[61] Additionally, in the
						same interview with Big Think, Tyson mentioned that he edited
						Wikipedia's entry on him to include the fact that he is an agnostic:
						I'm constantly claimed by atheists. I find this intriguing. In fact,
						on my Wiki page – I didn't create the Wiki page. Others did, and I'm
						flattered that people cared enough about my life to assemble it –
						and it said, "Neil deGrasse Tyson is an atheist." I said, "Well,
						that's not really true." I said, "Neil deGrasse Tyson is an
						agnostic." I went back a week later. It said, "Neil deGrasse Tyson
						is an atheist" again – within a week! – and I said, "What's up with
						that?" and I said, "All right, I have to word it a little
						differently." So I said, "Okay, Neil deGrasse Tyson, widely claimed
						by atheists, is actually an agnostic."[61] During the interview
						"Called by the Universe: A Conversation with Neil deGrasse Tyson" in
						2009, Tyson said: "I can't agree to the claims by atheists that I'm
						one of that community. I don't have the time, energy, interest of
						conducting myself that way... I'm not trying to convert people. I
						don't care."[62] Tyson in conversation with Richard Dawkins at
						Howard University, 2010 In March 2014, philosopher and secularism
						proponent Massimo Pigliucci asked Tyson: "What is it you think about
						God?" Tyson replied: "I remain unconvinced by any claims anyone has
						ever made about the existence or the power of a divine force
						operating in the universe." Pigliucci then asked him why he
						expressed discomfort with the label "atheist" in his Big Think
						video. Tyson replied by reiterating his dislike for one-word labels,
						saying: "That's what adjectives are for. What kind of atheist are
						you? Are you an ardent atheist? Are you a passive atheist? An
						apathetic atheist? Do you rally, or do you just not even care? So
						I'd be on the 'I really don't care' side of that, if you had to find
						adjectives to put in front of the word 'atheist'." Pigliucci
						contrasted Tyson with scientist Richard Dawkins: "[Dawkins] really
						does consider, at this point, himself to be an atheist activist. You
						very clearly made the point that you are not." Tyson replied: "I
						completely respect that activity. He's fulfilling a really important
						role out there."[63] Philosophy Tyson has spoken about philosophy on
						numerous occasions. In March 2014, during an episode of The Nerdist
						Podcast, he stated that philosophy is "useless" and that a
						philosophy major "can really mess you up",[64] which was met with
						disapproval.[65][66][67][68] The philosopher Massimo Pigliucci later
						criticized him for "dismiss[ing] philosophy as a useless
						enterprise".[69] Race and social justice In an undated interview at
						Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Tyson talked about being black and
						one of the most visible and well-known scientists in the world. He
						told a story about being interviewed about a plasma burst from the
						sun on a local Fox affiliate in 1989. "I'd never before in my life
						seen an interview with a black person on television for expertise
						that had nothing to do with being black. And at that point, I
						realized that one of the last stereotypes that prevailed among
						people who carry stereotypes is that, sort of, black people are
						somehow dumb. I wondered, maybe ... that's a way to undermine this
						sort of, this stereotype that prevailed about who's smart and who's
						dumb. I said to myself, 'I just have to be visible, or others like
						me, in that situation.' That would have a greater force on society
						than anything else I could imagine."[70][71] In 2005, at a
						conference at the National Academy of Sciences, Tyson responded to a
						question about whether genetic differences might keep women from
						working as scientists. He said that his goal to become an
						astrophysicist was "...hands down the path of most resistance
						through the forces ... of society". He continued: "My life
						experience tells me, when you don't find blacks in the sciences,
						when you don't find women in the sciences, I know these forces are
						real and I had to survive them in order to get where I am today. So
						before we start talking about genetic differences, you gotta come up
						with a system where there's equal opportunity. Then we can start
						having that conversation."[72] In a 2014 interview with Grantland,
						Tyson said that he related his experience on that 2005 panel in an
						effort to make the point that the scientific question about genetic
						differences can not be answered until the social barriers are
						dismantled. "I'm saying before you even have that conversation, you
						have to be really sure that access to opportunity has been level."
						In that same interview, Tyson said that race is not a part of the
						point he is trying to make in his career or with his life. According
						to Tyson, "[T]hat then becomes the point of people's understanding
						of me, rather than the astrophysics. So it's a failed educational
						step for that to be the case. If you end up being distracted by that
						and not [getting] the message." He purposefully no longer speaks
						publicly about race. "I don't give talks on it. I don't even give
						Black History Month talks. I decline every single one of them. In
						fact, since 1993, I've declined every interview that has my being
						black as a premise of the interview."[73] NASA Tyson, Bill Nye, and
						U.S. President Barack Obama take a selfie at the White House, 2014
						Tyson is an advocate for expanding the operations of the National
						Aeronautics and Space Administration. Arguing that "the most
						powerful agency on the dreams of a nation is currently underfunded
						to do what it needs to be doing".[74] Tyson has suggested that the
						general public has a tendency to overestimate how much revenue is
						allocated to the space agency. At a March 2010 address, referencing
						the proportion of tax revenue spent on NASA, he stated, "By the way,
						how much does NASA cost? It's a half a penny on the dollar. Did you
						know that? The people are saying, 'Why are we spending money up
						there...' I ask them, 'How much do you think we're spending?' They
						say 'five cents, ten cents on a dollar.' It's a half a penny."[74]
						In March 2012, Tyson testified before the United States Senate
						Science Committee, stating that: Right now, NASA's annual budget is
						half a penny on your tax dollar. For twice that—a penny on a
						dollar—we can transform the country from a sullen, dispirited
						nation, weary of economic struggle, to one where it has reclaimed
						its 20th century birthright to dream of tomorrow.[75][76] Inspired
						by Tyson's advocacy and remarks, Penny4NASA, a campaign of the Space
						Advocates nonprofit,[77] was founded in 2012 by John Zeller and
						advocates the doubling of NASA's budget to one percent of the
						federal budget.[78] In his book Space Chronicles: Facing the
						Ultimate Frontier Tyson argues that large and ambitious space
						exploration projects, like getting humans to Mars, will probably
						require some sort of military or economic driver in order to get the
						appropriate funding from the United States federal government.[79]
